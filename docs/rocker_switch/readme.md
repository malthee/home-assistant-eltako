# How to detect Switch Signals and react on thoese in Home Assistant

This example is about how to trigger complex automations in home assistant by wall-mounted rocker switches.

## Register switch and check incomging telegrams and events in logs

First of all you need to register your switch in the Home assistant Configuration ``/config/configuration.yaml``. Those switches are declared as `binary_sensor` and their EEP is `F6-02-01`. For more details about how to define the Home Assistant Eltako Integration configuration check out the [documentation how to write the configuration](../update_home_assistant_configuration.md) or if you are interested in auto-generating your configuration check out [enocean-device-manager](https://github.com/grimmpp/enocean-device-manager). 
The the declaration in the configuration you need to know the id or enocean address of your switch. You can find the address of your switches on a sticker at the back or you can just push a button and check the incoming telegrams in the logs. ([Here](../logging/readme.md) you can find how to use logging. debugging must be enabled for eltako to see the incoming telegram: `etlako: debug`)

See example snipped to declare your switch:
```
  binary_sensor:
    - id: "FE-DB-DA-04"  # taster 1
      eep: "F6-02-01"
    - id: "FE-DB-B6-40"  # taster 2
      eep: "F6-02-01"
```

After you have registered the switch in Home Assistant configuration and after you have restarted Home Assistant you can see messages in the logger view. (Debugging must be enabled.)

## Create automatin listening on switch events

To create an automation which reacts on switch events go in Home Assistant to ``Settings > Automation & Scenes > Create Automation``.
As trigger choose ``Manual Event`` and enter ``eltako.gw_[GATEWAY_BASE_ID].func_button_pressed.sid_[SWITCH_ID].d_[BUTTONS]`` as event id. Replace brackets `[GATEWAY_BASE_ID]` by the base_id of your gateway, `[SWITCH_ID]` by the switch id, and `[BUTTONS]` by the button positions. Gateway base id and switch id can be found in your configuration. Ids must be entered in the following format and in upper letters: `FF-AA-80-00`. Valid values for button positions are LT, LB, RT, RB (L = left, r = richt, T = top, B = bottom). Combinations are also possible. It always starts with left and then right. Valid values are: `LT-RT`, `LT-RB`, `LB-RT`, `LB-RB`.

You can find the button independent event id of the switch on the entity page as well. You can copy this event id and if you want to distinguish between different buttons pushed you need to add `.d_[BUTTONS]` like described above.

If you push two buttons at the same time it looks like the following:

Choose your action you would like to trigger in the action section. In the screenshot at the beginning I change the state of light (toggle mode).


## Advanced usage
Events will be send twice with different event_ids.
1. ``eltako.gw_[GATEWAY_BASE_ID].func_button_pressed.sid_[SWITCH_ID].d.[BUTTONS]`` (Described like above.)
2. ``eltako.gw_[GATEWAY_BASE_ID].func_button_pressed.sid_[SWITCH_ID]`` and without button information

Case 2 gives you the possibility to get all events of one rocker switch and to react with conditions on it. If you configure the same like above without the button positions then any button on your rocker switch will be detected. You can filter for specific buttons or button combinations on your switch by using conditions. To do so you need a ``template condition`` which is unfortunately not available in the webUI, therefore just switch to yaml mode in the right upper corner. 

### Automation Example Single Button

In my example below the automation is listening on a switch. There is one condition which filters out the upper left button. Only then the action is triggered. The action itself is a simple relay which is switched either on or off.:
```
alias: Eltako Taser Test - Single Button
description: ""
trigger:
  - platform: event
    event_type: eltako.gw_FF-AA-00-00.btn_pressed.sid_FE-DB-DA-04
condition:
  - condition: template
    value_template: >-
      {{ 'LT' in trigger.event.data.pressed_buttons and not
      trigger.event.data.two_buttons_pressed }}
action:
  - type: toggle
    device_id: fe25388ed8dcd06b38ca2efd736cdc0c
    entity_id: light.eltako_00000001
    domain: light
    enabled: true
mode: single
```
After saving the automation and by pushing the switch you can see a popup when the automation recognizes the event triggered by the switch.

### Automation Example Button Combination

In this example the upper left button and the lower right need to be pressed at the same time to change the light status.
```
alias: Trun light on
description: ""
trigger:
  - platform: event
    event_type: eltako.gw_FF-AA-00-00.btn_pressed.sid_FE-DB-DA-04
condition:
  - condition:
      - condition: template
        value_template: >-
          {{ 'LT' in trigger.event.data.pressed_buttons and 
          'RB' in trigger.event.data.pressed_buttons and
          trigger.event.data.two_buttons_pressed }}
action:
  - type: toggle
    device_id: db2490938e697f6d8b7fdae197ddfc35
    entity_id: 67ad5e7ce543e5915462892e92020b6c
    domain: light
mode: single
```

## Home Assistant Configuration

This action only works if you have previously registered the light/relay in the Home Assistant configuration. 
Below you can find the whole configuration of Home Assistant for this example:
```
# Loads default set of integrations. Do not remove.
default_config:

# Load frontend themes from the themes folder
frontend:
  themes: !include_dir_merge_named themes

# Text to speech
tts:
  - platform: google_translate

automation: !include automations.yaml
script: !include scripts.yaml
scene: !include scenes.yaml

eltako:
  general_settings:
    fast_status_change: False   # True: Changes status in HA immediately without waiting for actuator response. Default: False
  gateway:
  - id: 1
    device_type: fgw14usb            # Supported gateways: gam14, fgw14usb
    base_id: FF-AA-00-00
    devices:
      light:
      - id: "00-00-00-01"
        name: "Relay Test"
        eep: "M5-38-08"
        sender:
          id: "00-00-B0-01"
          eep: "A5-38-08"
      binary_sensor:
      - id: "FE-DB-DA-04"  # taster 1
        eep: "F6-02-01"
      - id: "FE-DB-B6-40"  # taster 2
        eep: "F6-02-01"
      
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    eltako: debug
```

In this example the sender id ``00-00-B0-01`` for the light must be registered in the corresponding relay e.g. via [Eltako Software PCT14](https://www.eltako.com/en/software-pct14/). Don't forget to choose function type ``51`` for software controlled command.

Code for detecting the switch and firing the event can be found in function ``value_changed`` in [binary_sensor.py](/eltako/binary_sensor.py).
